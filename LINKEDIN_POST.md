# LinkedIn Post - Portfolio Launch

I just launched a portfolio that shows what I actually build for clients.

Most people know me for Google Ads, but that's only part of it. I build the entire marketing technology stack—from custom landing pages to tracking infrastructure to applications that solve real problems.

Here's what's in there:

• Multi-city webinar campaigns with city-specific landing pages
• Service-specific promotions that shift focus to high-value offerings
• Custom SEO analysis tools that scrape and compare competitor content
• Fraud prevention pages optimized for phone conversions to combat form fraud
• Location-specific landing pages for multi-location businesses
• Rapid offer pages with full conversion tracking
• PPC-optimized pages that load faster and convert better
• Desktop applications that package AI models for end users

From code to conversion, I handle it all. Not just the ads—the infrastructure that makes them work.
