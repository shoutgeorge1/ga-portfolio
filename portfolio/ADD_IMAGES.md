# How to Add Your Images

I can't directly access the images you shared in chat. Here's how to add them:

## Option 1: Save Images Locally (Recommended)

1. **Download/save the images** you shared to your computer
2. **Rename them** to match these exact filenames:
   - `city-direct-mail-el-cerrito-desktop.webp`
   - `dr-dhir-rhyno-desktop.webp`
   - `rnd-vs-katz-seo-audit-desktop.webp`
   - `truglow-phone-offers-desktop.webp`
   - `balcony-design-permit-desktop.webp`
   - `dr-brent-call-tracking-desktop.webp`
   - `encino-dental-emergency-desktop.webp`
   - `monarch-landscape-desktop.webp`
   - `dj-gui-desktop.webp`

3. **Copy them** to: `/Users/george/GA-Portfolio/portfolio/public/portfolio/`

## Option 2: Share Image URLs

If you upload the images to:
- Imgur
- Google Drive (with public link)
- Dropbox (with public link)
- Any image hosting service

Share the URLs and I can download them automatically.

## Option 3: Drag & Drop

If you're using VS Code or Cursor:
1. Open the `/public/portfolio/` folder
2. Drag your images into that folder
3. Rename them to match the filenames above

Once the images are in place, they'll automatically appear on the portfolio page!
